An extension to help with common tasks around the WP back end.

Not really useful for external use (yet).

## Features

- automatically checks for presence of [author_more] tag in the text, and makes the field glow red if this tag is absent
- checks for relative links in text, warns about them
- provides Capitalize option under the title, which instantly titlecapitalizes it
- provides Copy Tags button under Tags, so you get a comma separated list of tags copied to the clipboard, in case you need to reuse them on another post
- the series input field which typically allows you to add a new series right from the Add / Edit post page now also serves as an insta-filter. Just type into it and unwanted series automatically hide
- removed Total Cache header popup
- headline analyzer included in the UI
